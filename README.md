# TP1 : Les tableaux et les chaines de caract√®res

This repository contains four Java exercises that focus on different programming concepts. The first exercise is about managing student grades, the second deals with conjugating first-group French verbs, the third focuses on string manipulation, and the last counts the occurrences of letters in a string. Each exercise includes code snippets and explanations to help you understand how the tasks are performed.


## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of arrays and strings in Java. It consists of several exercises demonstrating how to manage student grades, conjugate French verbs, manipulate strings, and count letter occurrences.

### Introduction

Arrays and strings are vital data structures in programming, particularly in object-oriented languages like Java. Arrays provide a way to store multiple elements of the same type, allowing for efficient data manipulation. They are commonly used for tasks such as sorting, searching, and performing statistical operations. In Java, arrays are objects that can store either primitive types or references to objects, offering flexibility for different use cases.

Strings, on the other hand, are used to represent sequences of characters, and are fundamental for handling textual data. In Java, strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created. This immutability ensures that string data remains secure, though it also introduces some challenges when manipulating them. Common string operations include concatenation, searching for substrings, reversing characters, and counting words.

Understanding these data structures is key to solving many programming problems, as they are the building blocks of numerous algorithms. In this lab, we explored different exercises that demonstrate the power and versatility of arrays and strings in Java programming.

 ## Technologies Used
- Java

## Usage
To run the exercises, simply execute the corresponding Java class files. Each class contains a main method to start the program.


## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Managing Student Grades  
This exercise involves writing a Java program that allows the user to input student grades, sort them, and then calculate useful statistics, such as the average grade, the highest and lowest grades, and the number of students achieving a specific grade.

#### 1. Sorting and Displaying Grades  
The program begins by prompting the user to input the number of students and their respective grades.
```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter the number of students:");
int numStudents = sc.nextInt();
float[] grades = new float[numStudents];
for (int i = 0; i < numStudents; i++) {
    System.out.println("Enter the grade for student " + (i + 1) + ":");
    grades[i] = sc.nextFloat();
}
```

Next, we use the Arrays.sort() method to sort the grades in ascending order and display them.
```java
Arrays.sort(grades);
System.out.println("Sorted student grades:");
for (int i = 0; i < numStudents; i++) {
    System.out.println(grades[i]);
}
```

#### 2. Calculating the Average Grade
To compute the average, we sum all the grades and divide by the number of students.
```java
float total = 0;
for (float grade : grades) {
    total += grade;
}
System.out.println("The average grade is: " + total / numStudents);
```
#### 3. Finding the Maximum and Minimum Grades
The highest and lowest grades are found by accessing the last and first elements of the sorted array, respectively.
```java
System.out.println("The highest grade is: " + grades[numStudents - 1]);
System.out.println("The lowest grade is: " + grades[0]);
```
#### 4. Counting Students with a Specific Grade
The user can enter a grade, and the program will count how many students received that grade.
```java
System.out.println("Enter the grade to search for:");
float gradeToFind = sc.nextFloat();
int count = 0;
for (float grade : grades) {
    if (grade == gradeToFind) {
        count++;
    }
}
System.out.println("Number of students with the grade " + gradeToFind + ": " + count);
```
